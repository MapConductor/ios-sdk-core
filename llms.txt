# MapConductor iOS Core (ios-sdk-core)

## Summary
MapConductor iOS Core provides provider-agnostic domain models and state/behavior for maps on iOS. It does not render maps or depend on any map SDKs or UI frameworks; those live in higher-level modules and provider drivers.

## Key Concepts
- Provider-independent map semantics and state
- Shared domain models (coordinates, camera, overlays, interaction semantics)
- Contracts for higher-level APIs and provider-specific drivers

## What This Module Does
- Defines core map domain models and interaction behaviors
- Provides abstract state used by map views and drivers
- Serves as the contract between UI layers and provider drivers

## What This Module Does Not Do
- Render maps or overlays
- Depend on MapKit/Google Maps/MapLibre/etc.
- Provide SwiftUI/UIView components

## Source Layout
- `Sources/MapConductorCore/` core models, state, controllers, overlays
- `Package.swift` Swift Package definition
- `README.md` architecture and philosophy overview

## Build/Integration
- Swift Package Manager module name: `MapConductorCore`
- Minimum platform: iOS 15 (see `Package.swift`)

## Notes for LLMs
- This module is framework-agnostic; avoid introducing SDK-specific logic here.
- Provider drivers and UI bindings should live outside this package.
- When adding functionality, keep APIs generic and composable.
